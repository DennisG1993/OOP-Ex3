# OOP - Ex3 Graph Algorithms using python.
## Instalation:

**To install this project you can simply clone it and either import your graph json or use one of the included graphs.**
* clone the project
* import a json graph from graph_data or one of your own
* run the project main file using python 3.7 or newer

## what was it all about:
this excerise was about implementing weighted  directed graph graph using python and most importantly implementing the next algorithms:
* find the shortest path from one node to the other
   [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) 
* find a list of strongly connected components
  [Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm)
* find strongly connected component starting from specific node
  [Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm)
* visualize the graph matplotlib
